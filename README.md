# Unified Compute Architecture

Welcome to the repository for *Unified Compute Architecture: A Roadmap for Post-GPU Processing*, a whitepaper proposing a next-generation computing paradigm that merges CPU and GPU responsibilities into a unified system. This architecture aims to address inefficiencies in current hardware designs and unlock new possibilities for performance, developer simplicity, and scalability.

## Overview

The traditional separation of CPUs and GPUs has led to memory duplication, communication bottlenecks, and fragmented programming models. This whitepaper outlines a vision to overcome these challenges through:
- **Unified Memory**: A shared, high-bandwidth memory pool for all processing units.
- **Unified Display Controller**: Display output managed by the SoC, not tied to the GPU.
- **Scope-Based Shaders**: A new programming model integrating logic, rendering, and compute without explicit draw calls.
- **Enhanced Features**: True SMT, floating-point hierarchy, and GPU feature backports to the CPU.

This approach promises benefits for diverse use cases—minimalist embedded systems, game engines, AI workloads, headless rendering, and multi-GPU setups—while aligning with trends in AI, mobile, and cloud computing.

## Whitepaper

The full document is available here:  
[**WHITEPAPER.pdf**](./WHITEPAPER.pdf)  
(Also available in [Markdown format](./WHITEPAPER.md) for easier editing and readability.)

## Goals

- **Share the Vision**: Present a bold idea for the future of computing hardware and software.
- **Gather Feedback**: Invite critique, suggestions, and discussion from developers, engineers, and researchers.
- **Foster Collaboration**: Encourage contributions to refine the architecture or explore implementations.

## How to Contribute

We’d love your input! Here’s how you can get involved:
- **Read the Whitepaper**: Start by checking out the document and let us know what you think.
- **Open an Issue**: Share feedback, ask questions, or propose ideas via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/SpaceDandy-Tama/UnifiedComputeArchitecture/issues).
- **Submit a Pull Request**: Suggest edits to the whitepaper or add supporting materials (e.g., diagrams, code snippets).
- **Discuss**: Join the conversation in [Discussions](https://github.com/SpaceDandy-Tama/UnifiedComputeArchitecture/discussions) to brainstorm or debate concepts.

## Next Steps

This is an early-stage proposal, and community input will shape its evolution. Potential future work includes:
- Refining the architecture based on feedback.
- Developing prototype simulations or proofs-of-concept.
- Collaborating with hardware/software experts to explore feasibility.
